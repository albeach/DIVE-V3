# Delete Test User & Re-Test SAML

**What Happened:** First login created a partial user with only username  
**Fix Applied:** Added SAML property mappers for email, firstName, lastName  
**Action Required:** Delete the partial user and test again

## What Was Fixed

**SAML Client Mappers (france-mock-idp realm):**
Added property mappers to send user profile fields in SAML assertion:
- ‚úÖ `email-property-mapper` - Sends email in SAML assertion
- ‚úÖ `firstName-property-mapper` - Sends first name in SAML assertion
- ‚úÖ `lastName-property-mapper` - Sends last name in SAML assertion

**SAML IdP Broker Mappers (dive-v3-pilot realm):**
Already configured to receive these attributes:
- ‚úÖ `france-email-mapper` - Receives email from SAML
- ‚úÖ `france-firstname-mapper` - Receives firstName from SAML
- ‚úÖ `france-lastname-mapper` - Receives lastName from SAML

**Result:** All fields should now be pre-populated from SAML assertion

---

## Future Logins

**After first successful login:**
- User account exists in dive-v3-pilot
- "Update Account Information" page will be **SKIPPED**
- Direct login to dashboard
- **No need to click Submit again**

---

## If Fields Still Not Pre-Filled

**Option: Just fill them in manually this ONE time:**

```
Email: pierre.dubois@defense.gouv.fr
First name: Pierre
Last name: Dubois

Click Submit
```

**Then check:**
- Dashboard should show correct FRA attributes
- Future logins will be automatic (page skipped)

**This is acceptable for pilot** - first login account setup is common in federated SSO

---

**Action Now:** Delete the user from dive-v3-pilot realm and test France SAML login again! The fields should now be pre-filled. üöÄ
