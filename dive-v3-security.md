# Security Guidelines Document for DIVE V3

## 1. Authentication & Authorization Rules

### OAuth Flows
- **Authorization Code Flow:** Utilize this flow for server-side applications to ensure security by exchanging authorization codes for access tokens.
- **Implicit Flow:** Avoid using this flow in production due to its security risks and reliance on public clients.
- **Client Credentials Flow:** Use for server-to-server communication where there is no user context.

### JWT Handling
- **Signing Algorithms:** Use strong algorithms such as RS256 for signing JWTs.
- **Token Expiration:** Set short-lived access tokens and use refresh tokens for obtaining new access tokens.
- **Token Revocation:** Implement token revocation mechanisms for both access and refresh tokens.

### RBAC Implementation
- **Role Definition:** Define roles based on user functions and assign permissions accordingly.
- **Role Assignment:** Ensure roles are assigned based on the principle of least privilege.
- **Audit Logs:** Maintain logs of role assignments and access to sensitive resources.

## 2. Data Validation Rules

### Input Sanitization
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use libraries like DOMPurify for sanitizing HTML inputs.

### Type Checking
- Implement strict type checking to ensure inputs conform to expected data types.
- Use TypeScript for type safety across the application.

### Boundary Validation
- Validate input lengths and value ranges to prevent buffer overflow and logical errors.
- Implement validation logic both on the client-side and server-side.

## 3. Environment Variables

### Secure Configuration
- Store sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and encryption secrets in environment variables.
- Use services like Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to manage secrets securely.

## 4. Rate Limiting/Throttling

### Limits Per Endpoint
- Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests per user/IP per endpoint.
- Use libraries like `express-rate-limit` for Node.js applications.

### DDoS Protection
- Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to mitigate DDoS attacks.
- Use Cloudflare or AWS Shield for additional DDoS protection.

## 5. Error Handling & Logging

### Logging Guidelines
- Log only non-sensitive information to prevent leakage of PII or sensitive data.
- Ensure logs are stored securely and access is restricted to authorized personnel.

### Secure Error Messages
- Provide generic error messages to users to prevent information disclosure.
- Log detailed error information internally for debugging purposes.

## 6. Security Headers/Configs

### CORS Settings
- Configure CORS to allow only specific origins and restrict methods and headers.
- Use `cors` middleware in Express.js to handle CORS settings.

### CSP Policies
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks.
- Define a strict CSP that includes only necessary script and style sources.

### HTTPS Enforcement
- Enforce HTTPS across all endpoints to ensure data is encrypted in transit.
- Use HSTS headers to ensure browsers only connect via HTTPS.

## 7. Dependency Management

### Package Updates
- Regularly update all dependencies to the latest stable versions.
- Use tools like `npm audit` and `yarn audit` to identify vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Integrate automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline using tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check.

## 8. Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest
- Encrypt sensitive data stored in databases using strong encryption algorithms.
- Utilize database features or file system encryption for data protection.

### Encryption in Transit
- Use TLS 1.2 or higher for encrypting data in transit.
- Configure secure cipher suites and ensure certificates are valid and up-to-date.

### PII Handling
- Minimize collection and storage of PII to reduce risk.
- Anonymize or pseudonymize PII where possible and implement access controls.

This document outlines the security measures and practices to be implemented for the DIVE V3 project to safeguard against potential threats and vulnerabilities. Regular reviews and updates to these guidelines are recommended to adapt to evolving security landscapes.
