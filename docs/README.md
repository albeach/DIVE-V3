# DIVE V3 Documentation

This repository has been aggressively pruned to keep only active, high-signal documentation.

## Canonical Docs

- Architecture index: [`docs/architecture/README.md`](architecture/README.md)
- OpenAPI spec (SP Registry): [`docs/api/sp-registry-openapi.yaml`](api/sp-registry-openapi.yaml)
- Postman docs: [`docs/postman/README.md`](postman/README.md)
- Postman collection: [`docs/postman/DIVE-V3-Federation-API.postman_collection.json`](postman/DIVE-V3-Federation-API.postman_collection.json)

## Root-Level Operational Docs

- Project overview: [`README.md`](../README.md)

## Policy

- Session notes, prompt history, archived reports, and one-off status docs are intentionally removed.
- Add only durable docs that describe current behavior, architecture, or operations.
