## ✅ Issue Resolved: Deploy Workflow Failure

### **Problem Identified:**
```
Deploy workflow triggered on every push to main
→ Tried to build Docker images
→ Required .env.production (doesn't exist)
→ FAILED ❌
```

### **Root Cause:**
- Deploy workflow set to auto-trigger on push to main
- Not ready for production deployment yet
- Missing production environment configuration
- Docker build fails without .env files

### **Solution Implemented:**
```yaml
# Before:
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

# After:
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger only
  # push:
  #   branches: [main]  # Commented out
```

**Result:** Deploy now manual-only, won't auto-fail ✅
