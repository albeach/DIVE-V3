# Install mkcert root CA into system trust store (Development Only)
# This allows Node.js fetch() API to trust self-signed mkcert certificates
# CRITICAL: Use --use-openssl-ca flag to make fetch respect system CAs
# This is the 2026 best practice for mkcert + NextAuth v5 + fetch API
# Production: Remove this step and use proper CA-signed certificates
# Note: CA will be mounted at runtime and copied to system trust store via entrypoint
RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/share/ca-certificates

# Note: Running as root initially for volume mount permissions
# Will drop privileges in startup command if needed
