- **Updated CI/CD pipeline**
- **Pre-commit hooks**

### **Documentation**

- `WEEK3.4.1-SUMMARY.md` (This document) ✅
- `backend/TESTING-GUIDE.md` (How to test)

---

## 🚀 Execution Strategy

### **Day 1-2: Critical Security Components**
Focus on testing the components that protect user data and enforce security policies:
- ZTDF cryptographic utilities (SHA-384, AES-256-GCM, integrity validation)
- PEP authorization middleware (JWT validation, OPA integration)
- Resource service (ZTDF validation, integrity checks)

**Why First**: These are the security foundation. If these have bugs, the entire system is compromised.

### **Day 2-3: Business Logic**
Test the middleware and services that implement business rules:
- Attribute enrichment (country inference, clearance defaults)
- Upload processing (ZTDF conversion, authorization checks)
- Policy management (OPA integration, policy testing)

**Why Second**: Business logic depends on security foundation being solid.

### **Day 3-4: API Layer**
Test the controllers and routes that expose functionality:
- Resource API endpoints
- Policy API endpoints
- Upload API endpoints
- Health check endpoints

**Why Third**: API layer is the thinnest layer, mostly orchestration.

### **Day 4-5: Production Readiness**
Configure CI/CD, documentation, and verification:
- GitHub Actions pipeline enforcement
- Coverage thresholds
- Pre-commit hooks
- Comprehensive documentation

**Why Last**: Only after all tests are written and passing.

## 🔍 Testing Approach

### **Unit Tests** (Isolation)
- Mock all external dependencies
- Test individual functions
- Fast execution (<1s per suite)
- Coverage target: ≥90% per module

### **Integration Tests** (Interaction)
- Mock external services (Keycloak, OPA)
- Real database (MongoDB Memory Server)
- Test multiple components together
- Coverage target: ≥80% per flow

### **E2E Tests** (Full Stack)
- Minimal mocking
- Test against real services
- Complete request-to-response flows
- Coverage target: All critical user journeys

---

## 🎯 Critical Path Components

**Must Test First** (Highest Risk):

1. **ZTDF Utilities** (`ztdf.utils.ts`)
   - SHA-384 hashing (STANAG 4778)
   - AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption
   - Integrity validation (cryptographic binding)
   - Display marking generation (STANAG 4774)

2. **PEP Middleware** (`authz.middleware.ts`)
   - JWT signature validation (JWKS)
   - OPA decision requests
   - Authorization enforcement
   - Decision caching (60s TTL)

3. **Resource Service** (`resource.service.ts`)
   - ZTDF integrity validation
   - Resource fetching
   - Backward compatibility (legacy format)
   - MongoDB error handling

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### **Before Week 3.4.1**
```
Coverage: 7.45% lines (134/1798)
Tests: 70 (admin, audit, upload, federation)
Test Files: 11
Test Code: ~3,000 lines
```

### **After Week 3.4.1**
```
Coverage: ≥80% lines (≥1,440/1798) ✅
Tests: 200+ (all components)
Test Files: 26 (15 new)
Test Code: ~8,000-9,500 lines
CI/CD: Enforced thresholds ✅
Production Ready: Yes ✅
```

### **Impact**
- ✅ **10.7x coverage increase** (7.45% → 80%)
- ✅ **2.9x more tests** (70 → 200+)
- ✅ **Production-grade quality**
- ✅ **CI/CD enforcement**
- ✅ **Regression protection**
- ✅ **Confidence for Week 4 deployment**

---

## 🚦 Go/No-Go Decision

**Week 3.4.1 MUST be complete before Week 4**

### **Week 4 Prerequisites**
Week 4 (E2E testing, demos, pilot report) **cannot start** until:
- ✅ Backend coverage ≥ 80%
- ✅ All critical components ≥ 90%
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline passes
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ Zero ESLint errors

**Rationale**: Week 4 focuses on integration and demonstration. We need a stable, well-tested backend as the foundation. Without adequate test coverage, we risk:
- Production bugs discovered during demos
- Regression issues from Week 4 changes
- Inability to confidently deploy
- Failed pilot due to quality issues

---
