## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current State

**DIVE V3 Compliance Achievement**: PERFECT 💎 (100%)
- 58/58 ACP-240 requirements fully implemented ✅
- 762 automated tests passing (100% pass rate) ✅
- Enterprise-grade security infrastructure ✅
- Production-ready for coalition deployment ✅

**The Challenge**: 
We have implemented extremely sophisticated features (Multi-KAS, COI keys, X.509 PKI, classification equivalency, etc.), but the UI/UX hasn't caught up to showcase these capabilities in an intuitive, actionable way for expert users.

**The Opportunity**:
Create a world-class UI/UX that makes complex security concepts instantly clear and actionable, following 2025 modern design patterns with emphasis on:
- **Visual clarity** for complex data relationships
- **Instant comprehension** of security posture
- **Guided workflows** from observation to action
- **Expert-friendly** without overwhelming novices
- **Beautiful & functional** modern design


### Your Mission

Design and implement a comprehensive UI/UX enhancement that:

1. **Visualizes ACP-240 Compliance** - Show the 100% compliance achievement
2. **Exposes Multi-KAS Features** - Make coalition scalability visible
3. **Explains COI Keys** - Help users understand community-based encryption
4. **Shows Classification Equivalency** - Cross-nation mapping clarity
5. **Displays X.509 PKI Status** - Certificate health and trust chains
6. **Guides Expert Users** - From observation → understanding → action
7. **Modern 2025 Design** - Glassmorphism, animations, micro-interactions
8. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
