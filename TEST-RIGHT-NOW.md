## 🚀 Test Now (3 Simple Steps)

### 1. New Incognito Window (CRITICAL!)
```
Cmd+Shift+N (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows)
```

### 2. Test Canada OIDC First
```
Go to: http://localhost:3000
Click: Canada (OIDC) 🇨🇦
Login: testuser-can / Password123!
Update page: Click Submit
Dashboard: Should show CAN, CONFIDENTIAL, [CAN-US]
```

### 3. Check Dashboard Bottom
```
Scroll down to "Session Details (Dev Only)"
Look for:
{
  "user": {
    "clearance": "CONFIDENTIAL",  ← Should see this
    "countryOfAffiliation": "CAN",  ← Should see this
    "acpCOI": ["CAN-US"]  ← Should see this
  }
}
```

## ✅ If You See Values → SUCCESS!

**If dashboard shows:**
- ✅ clearance: CONFIDENTIAL (not "Not Set")
- ✅ countryOfAffiliation: CAN (not "Not Set")  
- ✅ acpCOI: ["CAN-US"] (not "Not Set")

**Then:** ✅✅✅ **WEEK 3 IS WORKING!** ✅✅✅

**Next:** Test France and Industry to complete verification

## 🆘 If Still "Not Set"

**Take screenshot of:**
1. Dashboard showing "Not Set"
2. Session Details JSON at bottom of page

**Then I can debug from the actual session data**

**Action:** Test Canada in NEW incognito window RIGHT NOW! 🚀
