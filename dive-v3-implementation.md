# Implementation Plan for DIVE V3

## 1. Initialize Project
### 1.1 Framework Setup
- **Install Next.js:** Initialize a new Next.js project using the command `npx create-next-app@latest dive-v3`.
- **Install Dependencies:** Add necessary packages for the project:
  ```bash
  npm install react react-dom next-auth keycloak-js open-policy-agent opa-envoy-plugin
  ```
- **Set up TypeScript:** Convert the project to TypeScript by renaming files to `.tsx` and creating a `tsconfig.json`.

### 1.2 Folder Structure
- **Organize directories:**
  - `/pages`: For Next.js pages.
  - `/components`: Reusable UI components.
  - `/api`: API route handlers.
  - `/lib`: Utility functions and configurations.
  - `/styles`: Tailwind CSS styles.

### 1.3 Tooling Configuration
- **ESLint and Prettier:** Configure code linting and formatting.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Set up Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **GitHub Actions:** Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## 2. Set Up Auth
### 2.1 Auth Provider Integration
- **Keycloak Setup:** Configure Keycloak for federated sign-in using OIDC/SAML. Set up realms, clients, and protocol mappers.
- **NextAuth.js Configuration:**
  - Initialize NextAuth in `/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`.
  - Configure Keycloak as an identity provider.

### 2.2 Login/Signup Flow Implementation
- **Create Login Page:** Implement a page for IdP discovery and selection.
- **Session Management:** Ensure sessions are managed using NextAuth.js.

## 3. Build Frontend Pages
### 3.1 Order of Page Creation
- **Home Page:** Initial landing page with IdP selection.
- **Dashboard:** User dashboard displaying access decisions.
- **Document Viewer:** Secure document access and viewing.

### 3.2 Component Dependencies
- **Auth Components:** Components for login/logout and session display.
- **Policy Decision Display:** Component to show allow/deny results and obligations.

## 4. Create Backend Endpoints
### 4.1 API Development Sequence
- **Auth API:** Handle authentication requests and session validation.
- **Resource Metadata API:** CRUD operations for resource metadata in MongoDB.
- **Policy Evaluation API:** Endpoint for PEP to query OPA for authorization decisions.

## 5. Connect Frontend â†” Backend
### 5.1 API Integration
- **Frontend API Calls:** Implement API calls in React components to interact with backend endpoints.
- **State Management:** Use React Context or Redux for managing application state.

## 6. Add 3rd Party Integrations
### 6.1 Integration Needs
- **Key Access Service (KAS):** Integrate with KAS for key management.
- **Analytics:** Implement tools like Google Analytics for user tracking.

## 7. Test Features
### 7.1 Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Use Jest for testing individual components and functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Validate interactions between components using Playwright.
- **E2E Tests:** Simulate user flows with Puppeteer to ensure end-to-end functionality.
- **Test Data Setup:** Seed databases with mock data for testing purposes.

## 8. Security Checklist
### 8.1 Security Measures
- **Token Security:** Implement JWT token rotation and validation.
- **Data Protection:** Use encryption for sensitive data and secure storage.
- **Compliance:** Ensure alignment with ACP-240 and NATO labeling standards.

## 9. Deployment Steps
### 9.1 Build Process
- **Optimize Build:** Use Vercel or another platform for optimized Next.js builds.
- **Environment Configuration:** Set environment variables for different stages (dev, test, prod).

### 9.2 Hosting Setup
- **Containerization:** Use Docker for consistent deployment environments.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy on Google Cloud for scalability and reliability.

## 10. Post-Launch Tasks
### 10.1 Monitoring and Analytics
- **Set Up Monitoring:** Implement tools like New Relic or Datadog for application monitoring.
- **User Feedback Collection:** Enable feedback mechanisms within the app to gather user insights.

This implementation plan is designed to guide the development of the DIVE V3 project, ensuring a structured approach to achieving the specified goals and deliverables. Each section includes actionable tasks that align with the project's objectives and context.
