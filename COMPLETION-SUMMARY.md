# ✅ KAS & Content Viewer Enhancement - COMPLETE

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Time Invested**: ~45 minutes  
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: KAS Badge Not Visible ✅ RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: Badge existed but used minimal styling that didn't stand out.

**Solution Applied**:
- Enhanced with purple→indigo gradient
- Added animated lock icon (SVG)
- Applied pulse animation
- Increased prominence with bold font and shadow

**Impact**: KAS-protected resources now impossible to miss!

---

### Issue #2: Content Viewer Inadequate ✅ RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: Basic text-only viewer (`<p>{content}</p>`) couldn't handle images, PDFs, or binary files.

**Solution Applied**:
- Created intelligent `ContentViewer` component (300+ lines)
- Auto-detects content type from ZTDF metadata
- Renders 4 content categories:
  - **Images**: Zoom, fullscreen, loading states
  - **PDFs**: Embedded viewer with native controls
  - **Text**: Formatted with zoom controls
  - **Documents**: Download prompt for unsupported types

**Impact**: Professional, modern content viewing experience!
