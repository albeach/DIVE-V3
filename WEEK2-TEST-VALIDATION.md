## Week 2 CI/CD Migration Testing

This PR tests the new streamlined CI workflows created in Week 2.

### Expected Behavior

- ✅ All jobs should run in parallel (backend, frontend, OPA, terraform)
- ✅ Summary should show clear pass/fail status

### Workflows Triggered
- ci-fast.yml (this PR)
- ci-comprehensive.yml (already triggered on main push)

Week 2 validation in progress...
