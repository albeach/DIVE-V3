# ✅ Foundational Fixes - Session & Logout Issues Resolved

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

---

## 🔍 FOUNDATIONAL ISSUES DISCOVERED

### Issue #1: Logout Not Deleting Database Sessions

**What Debug Revealed:**
```
Active sessions in NextAuth database:
- Bob Contractor: 3 sessions (!)
- John MacDonald: 1 session
- All with future expiration dates

After "logout": Sessions still in database!
```

**Root Cause:** 
- NextAuth `signOut({ redirect: false })` only clears cookies
- With database session strategy, it does NOT delete from PostgreSQL
- Sessions remain valid in database
- Next login finds valid session → auto-logs in
- **This is a known NextAuth database adapter limitation**

**Fix Applied:** ✅ Created server-side logout route
```typescript
// frontend/src/app/api/auth/signout/route.ts (NEW)
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // Get session token from cookie
  // Delete session from database
  await db.delete(sessions).where(eq(sessions.sessionToken, sessionToken));
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
}
```

**Updated logout button to call this BEFORE NextAuth signOut**

### Issue #2: Pierre.dubois Always "Already Exists"

**What Debug Revealed:**
```
Keycloak dive-v3-pilot users:
- pierre.dubois@defense.gouv.fr EXISTS

Despite multiple deletion attempts!
```

**Root Cause:**
- Foreign key constraints preventing deletion
- user_attribute table references user_entity
- federated_identity table references user_entity
- Need CASCADE delete or delete in proper order

**Fix Applied:** ✅ Proper CASCADE deletion
```sql
DELETE FROM user_attribute WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM user_entity WHERE email = '...');
DELETE FROM federated_identity WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM user_entity WHERE email = '...');
DELETE FROM user_entity WHERE email = '...';
```

### Issue #3: Multiple Sessions Created

**What Debug Revealed:**
```
Bob Contractor has 3 sessions in database!
```

**Root Cause:**
- Each login creates new session
- Logout doesn't delete old sessions
- Sessions accumulate over time

**Fix Applied:** ✅ Server-side logout deletes sessions

---

## ✅ COMPLETE SOLUTION

### New Server-Side Logout Route

**File:** `frontend/src/app/api/auth/signout/route.ts` (CREATED)

**Purpose:**
- Delete session from PostgreSQL database
- Called BEFORE NextAuth signOut()
- Ensures complete cleanup

**Flow:**
```
1. User clicks "Sign Out"
   ↓
2. Call /api/auth/signout (server-side)
   - Deletes session from database ✅
   ↓
3. Clear localStorage/sessionStorage
   ↓
4. Call NextAuth signOut()
   - Clears cookies ✅
   ↓
5. Redirect to Keycloak logout
   - Terminates Keycloak session ✅
   ↓
6. Keycloak redirects to home page
   ↓
7. Complete logout - no active sessions anywhere ✅
```

### Updated Logout Button

**File:** `frontend/src/components/auth/secure-logout-button.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Step 1: Call server-side /api/auth/signout (NEW!)
- Step 2: Clear client storage
- Step 3: NextAuth signOut()
- Step 4-5: Keycloak logout

**Result:** Complete session cleanup ✅

## 🧪 TEST LOGOUT NOW

### Pre-Test: Restart Frontend
```bash
cd frontend && rm -rf .next && npm run dev
```

### Test Complete Logout Flow:

```
1. Login as Canada user:
   testuser-can / Password123!

2. Verify logged in (dashboard shows CAN attributes)

3. Click "Sign Out" button

4. Check browser console (F12):
   Should see:
   [DIVE] Starting logout process...
   [DIVE] Server-side logout complete
   [DIVE] Client storage cleared
   [DIVE] NextAuth signOut complete
   [DIVE] Redirecting to Keycloak logout

5. Should redirect to home page

6. CRITICAL TEST: Click any IdP button

7. Expected: Login form appears (NOT auto-logged in) ✅

8. If auto-logged in → Logout still not working

9. If shows login form → Logout FIXED ✅
```

---

## 🔍 If Logout Still Fails

### Check Database After Logout:

```bash
# After clicking logout, run this:
docker-compose exec -T postgres psql -U postgres -d dive_v3_app -c "
SELECT COUNT(*) as active_sessions FROM session;
"

# Should show: 0 sessions
# If > 0 → Server-side logout not being called
```

### Check Browser Cookies:

```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Application tab → Cookies → http://localhost:3000
3. After logout, should see:
   - NO __Secure-next-auth.session-token cookie
   - NO next-auth.session-token cookie

4. If cookies still there → Cookie clearing failed
```

### Check Keycloak Session:

```
# Check if Keycloak session persists
open http://localhost:8081/realms/dive-v3-pilot/account

# After logout, should require login
# If auto-logged in → Keycloak session not terminated
```

## 🎯 What Should Work Now

**Before Fix:**
- Logout cleared cookies only
- Database sessions remained
- Next login found valid session → auto-logged in ❌

**After Fix:**
- Logout calls server route → deletes database session ✅
- Clears cookies ✅
- Clears Keycloak session ✅
- Next login requires credentials ✅

---

## ✅ Pierre Deletion Status

**Pierre deleted from:**
- ✅ Keycloak dive-v3-pilot realm (with CASCADE)
- ✅ NextAuth database (all users cleared)

**Fresh France SAML test now possible** ✅

---

## 🚀 COMPLETE TEST SEQUENCE

**1. Restart Frontend** (Load new logout route)
```bash
cd frontend && rm -rf .next && npm run dev
```

**2. Test Canada + Logout**
```
Login: testuser-can
Dashboard: Verify CAN attributes
Logout: Click "Sign Out"
Console: Check for logout logs
Result: Redirected to home
Test: Click Canada again → Should show LOGIN FORM ✅
```

**3. Test France SAML**
```
Login: testuser-fra
Should NOT say "already exists" ✅
Dashboard: FRA, SECRET, [NATO-COSMIC]
```

**4. Test Industry + Enrichment**
```
Login: bob.contractor
Dashboard: USA (enriched), UNCLASSIFIED (enriched)
Console: Check enrichment logs
```

**Status:** ✅ Foundational fixes applied  
**Key Fix:** Server-side logout route that actually deletes database sessions  
**Action:** Restart frontend and test logout properly! 🚀
