   - Upload authorization in OPA policy

2. **Code Reusability:**
   - Existing ZTDF utilities reused
   - Existing authorization patterns extended
   - Existing UI components referenced

3. **Fail-Secure Pattern:**
   - Upload checks integrated into main allow rule
   - Helper functions always return boolean
   - Reason priority favors specific errors

4. **Type Safety:**
   - Strict TypeScript types
   - No `any` types used
   - Explicit return types
   - Interface-driven development

### Best Practices Followed

- ✅ Test-driven development (OPA tests first)
- ✅ Incremental implementation (6 days)
- ✅ Code review at each step (TypeScript compilation)
- ✅ Security-first (validation before processing)
