# DIVE V3 - Platform-Specific Overrides
# ============================================
# Usage:
#   ARM64 (Mac): docker compose up (uses native multi-arch images)
#   AMD64 (Ubuntu): docker compose up (uses native multi-arch images)
#   Force AMD64: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.platform.yml up
#
# This override file is only needed for specific platform requirements
# By default, all services will use the native architecture automatically

version: '3.8'

services:
  # Override OPA to force AMD64 if needed
  # Note: Only use this if you need to test AMD64-specific behavior on ARM64
  opa:
    platform: linux/amd64
    
  # Override Keycloak to force AMD64 if needed
  # The custom Dockerfile downloads curl-amd64, which should be made dynamic
  keycloak:
    platform: linux/amd64
