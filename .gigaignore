# ============================================
# .gigaignore — HARD ALLOWLIST
# Keep ONLY:
#   - backend/**
#   - frontend/**
#   - docker-compose.hub.yml
#   - docker-compose.template.yml (repo currently has templates/spoke/docker-compose.template.yml)
# Goal:
#   - stay under ~2,000 included files by excluding generated/low-signal bulk
# ============================================

# 1) Ignore everything (including deep paths)
*
**/*

# 2) Re-allow directories so traversal works (critical)
!*/
!***/

# 3) Allow ONLY these root files (must defeat default *.yml)
!/docker-compose.hub.yml
!/docker-compose.template.yml
!templates/spoke/docker-compose.template.yml

# 4) Allow ONLY these directories + their contents
!backend/
!backend/**

!frontend/
!frontend/**

# 5) Defense-in-depth: exclude junk even inside allowed trees
