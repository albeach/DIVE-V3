### **Priority 1: Security Foundation** 🔴
1. **ZTDF Utilities** (`ztdf.utils.ts`)
   - Current: 0% coverage ⚠️
   - Target: 95% coverage
   - Why: Cryptographic security foundation (SHA-384, AES-256-GCM)
   - Impact: Bugs here compromise entire system

2. **PEP Middleware** (`authz.middleware.ts`)
   - Current: 0% coverage ⚠️
   - Target: 90% coverage
   - Why: Policy enforcement point (authorization decisions)
   - Impact: Security vulnerabilities if untested

3. **Resource Service** (`resource.service.ts`)
   - Current: ~5% coverage ⚠️
   - Target: 90% coverage
   - Why: ZTDF validation and integrity checks
   - Impact: Data corruption if integrity fails

### **Priority 2: Business Logic** 🟡
4. Enrichment middleware (country inference)
5. Upload service (ZTDF conversion)
6. Policy service (OPA integration)

### **Priority 3: API Layer** 🟢
7. Controllers (orchestration)
8. Routes (HTTP layer)
9. Error handling (user experience)
